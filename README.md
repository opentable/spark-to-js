# spark-to-js
Search Template Generator. Convert Spark Templates to JS

## On Windows
You'll need msbuild installed and in your path. Installing Visual Studio does this for you.

## On a Mac/Linux
You'll need to install [mono](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/supported-platforms/osx/) and [xbuild](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/tools+libraries/tools/xbuild/) to use this project.

# Installing

Assuming you have the correct tools installed, you can install via npm:

```
npm install opentable/spark-to-js
```

# Run the built executable on a Mac/Linux

```
mono node_modules/spark-to-js/bin/TemplateGenerator.exe
```

# Run the built executable on Windows

```
node_modules/spark-to-js/bin/TemplateGenerator.exe
```
